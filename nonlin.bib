	abstract = {Taken literally, the title "All of Statistics" is an exaggeration. But in spirit, the title is apt, as the book does cover a much broader range of topics than a typical introductory book on mathematical statistics. This book is for people who want to learn probability and statistics quickly. It is suitable for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in computer science, mathematics, statistics, and related disciplines. The book includes modern topics like non-parametric curve estimation, bootstrapping, and classification, topics that are usually relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is presumed to know calculus and a little linear algebra. No previous knowledge of probability and statistics is required. Statistics, data mining, and machine learning are all concerned with collecting and analysing data.},

	title = {A {Computational} {Approach} to {Statistical} {Learning}},
	isbn = {978-1-138-04637-5},
	abstract = {A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning gives a novel introduction to predictive modeling by focusing on the algorithmic and numeric motivations behind popular statistical methods. The text contains annotated code to over 80 original reference functions. These functions provide minimal working implementations of common statistical learning algorithms. Every chapter concludes with a fully worked out application that illustrates predictive modeling tasks using a real-world dataset.  The text begins with a detailed analysis of linear models and ordinary least squares. Subsequent chapters explore extensions such as ridge regression, generalized linear models, and additive models. The second half focuses on the use of general-purpose algorithms for convex optimization and their application to tasks in statistical learning. Models covered include the elastic net, dense neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and spectral clustering. A unifying theme throughout the text is the use of optimization theory in the description of predictive models, with a particular focus on the singular value decomposition (SVD). Through this theme, the computational approach motivates and clarifies the relationships between various predictive models.

	abstract = {Nestling begging behaviour may be an honest signal of need used by parents to adjust optimally both feeding rate and within-brood food allocation. Although several studies showed that mothers and fathers can be differentially responsive to nestling begging behaviour with one parent showing a stronger tendency to feed the offspring that beg the most, little information is yet available on whether offspring beg for food at different intensities from the mother than father. In the present study, we investigated in nestling barn owls whether the intensity of vocal begging behaviour in the presence of the mother and in the presence of the father is different. A difference is expected because reproductive tasks are divided between the sexes with fathers bringing more food items to the nest than mothers. The results show that although mothers transfer their prey item to one of the offspring more rapidly than fathers once in their nestbox, nestlings begged more intensely in the presence of their mother than in the presence of their father. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence that offspring vocalize to different levels in the presence of their mother than in the presence of their father.},
