## lots of parameters (high dimensionality)

- not really an intrinsic problem
- visualization is difficult
- slow

## slowness

- [@ross_faster_2013](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/4/25/faster-talk.html):
      - rewrite in C++
      - parallelize (hard in this case)


## discontinuities and thresholds

- Nelder-Mead
- profiling

## multi-modality

- can be very hard to tell (Simon Wood examples)
- check convergence
- KKT criteria, locally
- multi-start algorithms
     - random
	 - Latin hypercube
	 - Sobol sequences
- cumulative distribution of neg log likelihoods [@raue_lessons_2013]
- stochastic global optimization

## constraints (box)

- independent inequality constraints
- built into some optimizers (`optim/L-BFGS-B`, `nloptr` tools)
- transformations 
     - convenient; can also improve Wald approximation, improve scaling
     - bad if parameter is actually *on* the boundary
