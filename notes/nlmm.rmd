## Nonlinear mixed models

- **Gaussian** response (i.e., not generalized)

## nlme package: advantages

- well-established, stable
- reasonably well-documented [@pinheiro_mixed-effects_2000]
- flexible heteroscedasticity models (`weights` argument)
- residual correlation/R-side effects (`correlation` argument)

## nlme: disadvantages

- Gaussian responses only
- relatively slow
- crossed effects are hard

## lme4::nlmer

- **in principle** way better
- nonlin function needs derivatives provided
- fixed effects are **hard** to incorporate (need to write the function yourself, or hack the output of `derivs`)
